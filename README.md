# DSC640

This project was (mostly) about visualizations. The notebook contains some of the standard stuff regarding reading, cleaning, and transforming data. But the result of the project
was building a dashboard and an infographic. 

I used some of the visualizations generated from pandas/seaborn/matplotlib in external programs such as InkScape or Powerpoint to fine tune edits to color/size/font/text/etc.
